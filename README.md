Brief Description:

I initially wanted to use a client bundled GPT to analyze articles and generate table of contents.
It was to use Python to convert the model to its JS equivalent, and utilize that in the client.
It didn't make sense as it was going to be unnecessarily heavy. I opted to use a web scrapper (Puppeteer) to achieve it.
